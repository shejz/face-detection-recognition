# **Face Detection and Recognition**

**How face recognition is different from face detection**

> Face detection and face recognition are distinctly different algorithms. 
- **Face detection** will tell you where in a given image/frame a face is (but not who the face belongs to) 
- **Face recognition** is the process of taking a face in an image and actually identifying who the face belongs to. Face recognition is thus a form of person identification that actually identifies the detected face.

**4 Face Detection Methods**:
1. (OpenCV Haar Cascades)[https://github.com/shejz/face-detection-recognition/tree/main/Face%20Detection%20with%20Haar%20Cascades]
2. OpenCV SSD Face Detector
3. Dlib HOG + Linear SVM Implementation
4. Dlib CNN Face Detector
