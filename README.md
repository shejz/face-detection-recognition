# **Face Detection and Recognition**

**How face recognition is different from face detection**

> Face detection and face recognition are distinctly different algorithms. 
- **Face detection** will tell you where in a given image/frame a face is (but not who the face belongs to) 
- **Face recognition** is the process of taking a face in an image and actually identifying who the face belongs to. Face recognition is thus a form of person identification that actually identifies the detected face.

**4 Face Detection Methods**:
- [OpenCV Haar Cascades](https://github.com/shejz/face-detection-recognition/tree/main/Face%20Detection%20with%20Haar%20Cascades)
- [OpenCV SSD Face Detector](https://github.com/shejz/face-detection-recognition/tree/main/SSD%20Face%20Detector)
- [Dlib HOG + Linear SVM and MMOD CNN](https://github.com/shejz/face-detection-recognition/tree/main/Face%20Detection%20with%20Dlib)
